## Introduction {.mf-h2}
The web has changed a lot. It used to be that all you had to know was HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Since the launch of React, Vue and friends the focus has shifted to JavaScript, and HTML comes second. It might be alarming to know that the component you spent hours making, actually exists natively already. In this article, I'll take you through some new elements that you might know have heard about. {.mf-body}

## What is Semantic HTML anyway? {.mf-h2}
In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".) {.mf-body}

In HTML, for example, the ```<h1>``` element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page." {.mf-body}
