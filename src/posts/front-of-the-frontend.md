## Introduction {.mf-title}

The web has changed a lot over the years. There was a clear difference between front-end and back-end developers, both in skillsets and knowledge. Nowadays, the lines have blurred. Since the launch of React, Vue and friends the focus has shifted to a JavaScript landscape, whilst people might retain the title of 'Front-End Developer', there's an emerging difference in their skillsets. {.mf-body}

There's the developers who have always expressed a visual interest, specialising in creating lean and beautiful user experiences (with accessibility and usability in mind), and those who sit closer to a traditional software developer where their specialism is in creating performant and elegant logic and behaviour in the front end. {.mf-body}

## Am I a Front-End Developer?{.mf-title}

This question should be easier than it is these days, there's been loads of discussion of the differences in opinion and how, if it at all the role of 'Front-End Developer' can have different responsibilities:{.mf-body}

  {.mf-list}

I certainly make stuff on the web, websites, apps, experiments but I don't tend to work with any 'heavy' JavaScript or other programming languages for anything outside of presentational usages such as adding behaviour to interactables, rendering stuff to a screen and so on. {.mf-body}

When I was at University, I always felt that I sat somewhere in between typical Computer Science types (programmers and network engineers etc.) and the graphic/print design world. I've always liked and appreciated good type and layouts in all forms, but I also really enjoy building user interfaces and creating experiences for people and being able to say that I made a thing.{.mf-body}

Personally, I call myself a front-end developer because I build things on the **front-end** of the web, I _develop_ it. Regardless of what I use to do it, that's I'm doing. Until my role sits closer to **UX Design** or research, I'm not _really_ a **UX Engineer**. {.mf-body}

## A nightmare for HR {.mf-title}

Understandtably, having diverging skillsets and specialisms can make hiring a 'Front-End Developer' a confusing task. When a company posts the position as available, how do they know what type of Developer they need?{.mf-body}

Not every website is the same, and not every business or organisation is able to use the 'latest and greatest' technologies, so there's a need for developers to be able to still make WordPress based websites, or websites without UI Frameworks like React, Vue etc.{.mf-body}

The issue therefore is what skills you list any applicant needs to be able to do the role, do you just list everything web related, or list the things you need and hope the developer will learn new things while they're there?{.mf-body}

Personally, I think it's a case by case basis. We have those who are working with non-JS based websites (PHP, ASP.&zwnj;NET, Rails, Python) that need different skillsets than a React based website might need, there's evidently a necessity for a blended approach to recruitment but there's also another role that can sit between the Designers and the Engineers.{.mf-body}

## A calling for specialists, not generalists{.mf-title}

Big-Tech, particularly the likes of <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/ideas/career-tips/what-is-ux-engineer/" target="_blank" class="mf-link mf-link-inline">Adobe</a> and <a href="https://design.google/jobs/ux-engineer/" target="_blank" class="mf-link mf-link-inline">Google</a> have started using the term 'UX Engineer' (which is often synonymised with UI Developer, Frontend Designer, Design Engineer among others). This role acts as a middleman between Designers and Software Engineers:{.mf-body}

- They understand UX principles and best practices, but they won't spend their time doing research, creating user flows etc.{.mf-list-item}
- They have a keen eye for aesthetics, but won't spend time debating over font pairings, colours or creating artwork.{.mf-list-item}
- They're technically minded, and can write traditional programming languages like JavaScript, PHP and friends but might not write application-levle code, debugging or hooking up middleware.{.mf-list-item}
- They understand the need for backend development, but won't write logic, manage servers or load balance network traffic etc.{.mf-list-item}
  {.mf-list}

Quite often in smaller businesses and organizations, designers and developers will wear several hats, some excel in designing but can also produce clean HTML, CSS and behavioural JavaScript (event handling, animations etc.). Or you might be a developer that could qualify as 'full-stack' though you prefer the UI & UX side of the web than the performance of an algorithm for example.{.mf-body}

<a href="https://www.bradfrost.com" class="mf-link mf-link-inline">Brad Frost</a> is a well-known and accredited speaker, web designer and writer, famous for his book called Atomic Design, he wrote a piece on this topic which inspired this post:{.mf-body}

> HTML is not a programming language. CSS is not a programming language. But because HTML and CSS are still technically code, frontend development is often put in the same bucket as Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, C++, and other programming languages. This misunderstanding tends to give many frontend developers, myself included, a severe identity crisis.

Unfortunately, the career of a UX Engineer/Front End Designer/UI Engineer is a tough one to break into as it's so niche. Unless you live in a city where there are numerous companies, especially larger ones where they have the ability, and need to hire specialist roles; finding work as a UX Engineer can be tough (unless you're remote).{.mf-body}

## What does the future look like then?{.mf-title}

It's hard to say. I'd like to imagine a utopia where there's a relationship between, design and engineers that is coupled with middlemen. But office politics, budgets and software makes it much more confusing and opinionated.{.mf-body}

My view is that we won't _always_ be using the latest and greatest(?) technologies and things may change down the line. So the only constant is the fundamentals of what it takes to get pixels on a page in a browser. That's HTML for the stuff, CSS for the branding and JavaScript so people can use the thing in more ways.{.mf-body}

Selfishly, I'd love to sit in a team as a UX/UI Engineer focusing purely on the visuals and accessibility of software but the reality is that almost always, if you're the person that can put shit on the web you're bound to wear other hats too. We won't ever see a Front, Middle and Back to the web development world because there are too many variables (no pun intended) to ever have an industry wide career.{.mf-body}
